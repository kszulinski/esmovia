# Pokébase

Application built with React, Vite, and TypeScript. It features user authentication using a dummyJSON API, fetching Pokémon data from the PokeAPI, and managing a list of favorite Pokemon. Somehow, it works

## Features

- User authentication with login and registration.
- Fetch and display a list of Pokemon from the PokeAPI.
- Add or remove Pokemon from a list of favorites.
- View details of individual Pokémon.
- Responsive design using React Bootstrap.
- Admin page to set the number of Pokémon displayed per page (but everyone can acces it bc I'm to lazy to change it).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have following things installed (or it will not work lol):

- Node.js 
- npm 
(note: idk which version, just get the latest)
### Installation Guide (very hard)

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/kszulinski/esmovia.git
cd esmovia
```
boom, you've got it
do what you want with it
