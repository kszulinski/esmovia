# Pokébase

Application built with React, Vite, and TypeScript. It features user authentication using a dummyJSON API, fetching Pokémon data from the PokeAPI, and managing a list of favorite Pokémon. Somehow, it works

## Features

- User authentication with login and registration.
- Fetch and display a list of Pokémon from the PokeAPI.
- Add or remove Pokémon from a list of favorites.
- View details of individual Pokémon.
- Responsive design using React Bootstrap.
- Admin page to set the number of Pokémon displayed per page (but everyone can acces it bc I'm to lazy to change it).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed (or it will not work lol):

- Node.js (>= 12.x)
- npm (>= 6.x) or yarn

### Installation Guide (very hard)

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pokemon-favorites-spa.git
cd pokemon-favorites-spa
